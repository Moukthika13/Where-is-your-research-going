This is an attempt to understand research patterns in a particular area with the help of a topic modeling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA). The aim is to extract clusters of similar documents from a large corpus, ﬁnd the distances between documents and assess the closeness of documents with a particular document/ topic in the corpus. 

The papers were collected from arXiv.org using the website’s API.
